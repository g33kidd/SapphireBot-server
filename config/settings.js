/**
 * Settings
 *
 * Primarily for defining the application default settings.
 * Everything that can be configured by the client, should be defined here.
 *
 * When the application starts, we run a series of initialization functions
 * that check if these settings are fields in the database.
 * 
 * If a setting is missing, we'll create the setting and give it a default value.
